DEPENDENCIES

Maca reuiqres several development packages in order to be built, primarily:
 * Corpus2
 * Toki
Other dependencies (some of them indirect via the two libraries above) are:
 * ICU (libicu-dev)
 * Boost libraries, 1.41 or later (libboost1.42-all-dev)
 * Loki (libloki-dev)
 * LibXML++ (libxml++2.6-dev)
 * 

Plugins require other libraries that are optional:
 * The SFST plugin requires the libsfst1-dev package
 * The Morfeusz plugin requires the Morfeusz library and header
 * The Guesser plugin requires the Guesser package from TaKIPI / Corpus


USAGE

See the maca-analyse and maca-convert binaries.


NOTES

Spurious "array subscript is above array bounds" warnings originating in bits/stl_algo seem to be an artifact of gcc4.4's overly-eager correctness checking in conjunction with boost::algorithm::split and boost::is_any_of. Apparently, they are harmless.
